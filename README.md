# FakeNewsDetector

You will find the attached zip file which consists of following 04 files :

    1.) solution_FakeNewsDetector.ipynb  (jupyter notebook) , Or  
    2.) solution_FakeNewsDetector.html (HTML file of the same notebook
    3.) test.csv (provided test set)
    4.) Submission.csv (predictions or the final output on the given test data "test.csv")
  
    "train.csv" (provided training set, because of large file size, not upladed here)
  
BERT approach (a transformer based machine learning technique for NLP) has been used to solve this problem statement.

I would recommend having a look at the attached .html file to get the end to end flow, graphs & visuals. 

Because running the .ipynb file to see the output, it might take a long.
